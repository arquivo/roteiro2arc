<h1>rot13</h1>
rot13 --A simple encryption command used to avoid offending sensitive eyes on
Usenet.  Thus a dirty joke told unencrypted in alt.tasteless might be
reposted in rot13 to alt.humor.best-of-usenet.  Rot13 simply rotates each
letter 13 places so that a becomes m, B becomes N, etc.  A simple command
(such as D in nn) decrypts the offensive material.
