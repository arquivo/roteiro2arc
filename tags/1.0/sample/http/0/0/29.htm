<DT>Q.<DD>Why is it slow?
<DT>A.<DD>
The map rendering server is a SPARCstation 2 in Palo Alto, California.
With a good network connection it seems to take a minimum of 3-4 seconds
to retrieve a document with embedded map image.  Time goes into
reading and filtering the map
vector data, rendering the image, converting the image into GIF format,
sending it over the network to the client browser, and finally
displaying it on your X display.  Changing resolution, geographical
location, or map features can cause additional database files to be
accessed (thus additional delays).  If it takes longer than 5-10 seconds, the cause is most likely a slow network connection between your
client and the server.
<P>
As use of the map viewer continues to increase (see
<A HREF="../../dium.htm" >graph</A>), the server is becoming overloaded, which may cause slow response or rejected requests.  We are planning to move the map viewer to a more powerful server machine (Feb. 1995).
<P>
<DT>Q.<DD>Where do I find out more about map rendering programs?
<DT>A.<DD>See
<A HREF="../../dium.htm">ftp://spectrum.xerox.com/pub/map</A> for a collection of map software and data.

<P>
<DT>Q.<DD>How do I download a map image using a text-only Web browser (or retrieve the image to a file using a graphical browser)?
<DT>A.<DD>Depending on the client software you are using, the following may work:  select the Map Viewer's "<A HREF="../../dium.htm" >Hide Map Image</A>" option and then the "<A HREF="../../dium.htm" >Retrieve Image for Separate Viewer</A>" option.  Some browsers will then allow you to store the image to a local file.

<P>
<DT>Q.<DD>How did you get the map images into gif format?  Did you scan?
<DT>A.<DD>The map images are not scanned, they are generated on demand from vector map data using software developed at Xerox PARC.
The conversion to GIF format uses software derived from the public domain "pbmplus" graphics package.

<P>
<DT>Q.<DD>Is the map viewer software publically available or for sale?
<DT>A.<DD>Sorry, not currently.

<P>
<DT>Q.<DD>What are the data sets used?
<DT>A.<DD>The world map data is from the CIA World Data Bank II.
The higher resolution U.S. data is from the USGS 1:2,000,000-Scale Digital Line Graph (DLG) Data.

<P>
<DT>Q.<DD>Are the images generated by the map viewer copyrighted?
<DT>A.<DD>The map data is public domain (courtesy of the U.S. government).

<P>
<DT>Q.<DD>How do I get a copy of the CIA World Data Bank II database?
<DT>A.<DD>Apparently it is distributed by the National Technical Information Service (NTIS).

<P>
<DT>Q.<DD>How do I get a copy of the USGS Data Line Graph CD-ROM?
<DT>A.<DD>Questions regarding availability and ordering of US GeoData (all types
of digital cartographic and geographic data produced and distributed
by the U.S. Geological Survey) should be addressed to:
<PRE>
       Earth Science Information Center
       U.S. Geological Survey
       507 National Center
       Reston, Virginia  22092
       (703)860-6045
       (800)USA-MAPS
</PRE>
For details see the <A HREF="../../dium.htm" >DLG Data Users Guide</A>,
<A HREF="../../dium.htm" >feature codes</A>,
and <A HREF="../../dium.htm" >DLG data sources</A>.
Also try the <A HREF="../../dium.htm">USGS HTTP Server</A>.

<P>
<DT>Q.<DD>Is there a net-source for DLG data?
<DT>A.<DD>Try <A HREF="../../dium.htm">ftp://spectrum.xerox.com/pub/map</A>

<P>
<DT>Q.<DD>The map document generates custom HTML documents in reponse to
user events.  Is the
functionality I want part of the custom HTTP server that you mention, or is
this functionality available as part of a standard WEB server?  
<DT>A.<DD>It is part of the custom HTTP server.  However standard Web servers can be enhanced by adding cuustom software.

<P>
<DT>Q.<DD>Do you know of any programs for displaying the Cartographic data, DLG and
DEM files, in the MSDOS environment?  
<DT>A.<DD>No, although there is a simple demo program on the USGS CD-ROM.
I tried it once and it was very slow.

<P>
<DT>Q.<DD>How do I save the maps I generate in a postscript format?  
<DT>A.<DD>The map viewer does not generate PostScript, but the client or image viewer you use may be able to.  Try using the "Save As" option of your WWW browser or external image viewer.

<P>
<DT>Q.<DD>Do the maps have labels (i.e. names of towns, roads, etc.?)
Are they topographic with elevations?  What I got was a "skeleton" with
only a few line features shown.
<DT>A.<DD>The map data I have contains only line data such as
coastlines, borders, rivers, roads.   I do not currently have the data
or software to add labels or topographic information to the maps.

<P>
<DT>Q.<DD>I am curious how you maintain
the information that when I consecutively click
on the same x-y-coordinates in successive 
pictures, I get a further zoom-in (how to reconcile
this with the fact that the protocol is stateless
and the URL is the same each time).
<DT>A.<DD>The URL is not the same each time.  All the necessary state
including the latitude, longitude and scale parameters are included in
each URL.

<P>
<DT>Q.<DD>How about adding some descriptive information about the various map
projections used?
<DT>A.<DD>The three available map projections were chosen for their ease of implementation in that all parallels are equally spaced.
<UL>
<LI>
The <A HREF="../../dium.htm" >equirectangular projection</A> (<EM>not</EM> the same as Mercator's) simply maps longitude and latitude linearly onto x and y coordinates such that the equator and all meridians are standard.
<LI>
In the <A HREF="../../dium.htm" >sinusoidal projection</A>, the linear scale along the parallels and the central meridian is correct.
<LI>
The <A HREF="../../dium.htm" >ellipse projection</A> used here is similar to Mollweide's projection, but because the parallels are equally spaced, relative sizes are not preserved.  Only the equator and central meridian are standard.
</UL>

<P>
<DT>Q.<DD>The borders for eastern Europe
and the former USSR are not quite up to date.
Do you have any idea where I could get current maps?
<DT>A.<DD>The world map data I have is from 1985-1990.
I do not know off hand where to get more recent data.

<P>
<DT>Q.<DD>Tie this to the geography server so people could type names?
<DT>A.<DD>It has been done by Brandon Plewe.  See his
<A HREF="../../dium.htm">U.S. Gazeteer</A> server.

<P>
<DT>Q.<DD>How do I specify dimensions for the output picture?
<DT>A.<DD>Use the <A HREF="../../dium.htm" >/iwd and /iht</A> options (<A HREF="../../dium.htm" >example</A>).

<P>
<DT>Q.<DD>Can I mark the long/lat specified in the URL with a symbol?
<DT>A.<DD>Use the <A HREF="../../dium.htm" >/mark</A> option.

<P>
<DT>Q.<DD>The Map Viewer doc should show you the
exact search string you typed (or could
have typed) to get there.
<DT>A.<DD>It does with the <A HREF="../../dium.htm" >Hide Map Image</A> option.

<P>
<DT>Q.<DD>Is there a legend available for the map colors?
<DT>A.<DD>See <A HREF="../../dium.htm" >World Map Legend</A>
	and  <A HREF="../../dium.htm" >U.S.A. Map Legend</A>.


<P>
<DT>Q.<DD>I see grid lines that look like they're about on 1 degree spacing.  Are they really at 1 deg intervals?
<DT>A.<DD>It automatically choses a spacing of 15, 10, 5, 3, 2, or 1 degrees depending on the scale.

<P>
<DT>Q.<DD>The horizontal grid lines (parallels) appear to be at whole degrees of latitude from the equator. But the vertical (meridian) grid lines are centered on the center of the map, and are not whole degrees of longitude from Greenwich.
<DT>A.<DD>Unfortunately this is true.  It is due to the simple way the coordinate system rotation was implemented.  I am afraid I have no time available to fix this.


<P>
<DT>Other suggestions from users:
<DD>
<UL>

<LI>It would be nice
if you had a page of links to a nice map of every state.

<LI>Automatic annotation of the CIA fact book would be cool.

<LI>it would be nice if the map could be sent in
encapsulated postscript form.

</UL>
