<hr>
Berlin, Germany, capital of a united Germany from 1871 to 1945
and again since 1990.  Its name probably comes from a word for
island;its slight elevation made it a site for human settlement
even inprehistoric times.  The city has a population of about
3,433,700 and has an area of approximately 889sq km (343 sq mi). <P>

After World War II (1939-45) Berlin, badly damaged during the
war, was surrounded by the German Democratic Republic (GDR; also
known as East Germany), and was partitioned into East Berlin and
West Berlin.  The divided city not only symbolized the collapse of
the German Empire, of which it was the capital, but also became a
focus of cold-war tensions between the Communist nations led by
the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) and the group of
Western nations led by the United States.  The Berlin Wall, a wall
separating East and West Berlin and built by the East Germans in
1961, blocked free access in both directions until 1989; by the
time Germany was unified in October 1990, much of the wall had
been torn down.  <P>

<H4>Divided City</H4>

When Germany was divided into American, Soviet, British, and
French occupation zones after World War II, Berlin, although
located within the Soviet Zone, became a separate unit.  The
arrangement symbolized the city's continuing role as the capital
of a Germany that was still considered one country.  In 1948,
however, soon after the breakup of the four-power administration
of the former nation of Germany, the joint administration of
Berlin also came to an end.  Claiming that Berlin had lost its
status as the capital of a united Germany and should therefore be
incorporated into the Soviet Zone, the USSR tried to force the
Western powers out of their respective sectors of the city by
blockading the land routes to that part of Berlin.  The attempt
was foiled with a massive airlift, but the city remained divided
into two parts.  At the peak of the airlift they flew in nearly 
13,000 tons in one single day.  Soviet-held East Berlin was
eventually incorporated into the GDR (East Germany), but West
Berlin remained a separate territory, with its own government and
close economic and cultural ties to the Federal Republic of Germany
(FRG; also known as West Germany).  In 1961 the East German
government built the Berlin Wall, a wall along the dividing line
between East and West Berlin, to stop the flight of East Germans
to West Berlin and from there to West Germany.  <P>
  
By the 1980s West Berlin once again enjoyed a rich cultural life
and material prosperity, thanks to West German government
subsidies.  East Berlin, which in 1953 was the scene of an
uprising of desperate workers, also improved in major ways; by
the 1980s it too was a well-known cultural center, and its
government quarter had been completely rebuilt.  West Berliners
gained access to East Berlin in 1972, but East Berliners could
not pass freely into West Berlin until late 1989, when
dismantling of the wall began.  When Germany reunified in October
1990, a reunited Berlin once again became the national capital;
the seat of the federal government was scheduled to shift from
Bonn to Berlin over a 12-year period beginning in 1991.  <P>
