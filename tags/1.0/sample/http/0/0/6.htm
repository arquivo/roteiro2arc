Welcome to Patch American High School, located at

 US EUCOM, the <A HREF="../../dium.htm">United States European Command</A>, in
Vaihingen, a small section of 
<A HREF="../../dium.htm" >Stuttgart</a>, Germany.  <p>

Built in 1979, Patch is a testbed site for technology insertion programs in the 
<A HREF="../../dium.htm" >Department of Defense Dependents Schools</a> system. The post and school are named after Lt. General Alexander M.
Patch. <p>

As exemplified by our

Patch are always <i>on the prowl </i> for exciting ways to improve our school
and community.  This home page, under development by students working
in a number of projects, can link you to a variety of resources in the school,
in the DoDDS system, and around the world.
