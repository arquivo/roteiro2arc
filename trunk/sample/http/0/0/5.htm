          When the weather starts to get cold, many people pack their
          bags and head South to warmer climates.  Now not ALL of us
          are lucky enough to have the money or the time to do this
          every year, but imagine not even having the OPTION to plan a
          trip like this. This is the way the inhabitiants of Eastern
          Berlin must have felt from the time the Berlin Wall was
          erected to the time it fell.<P>
               During World War II, Berlin was destroyed by British
          and U.S, bombing planes.  Then Soviet Artillery moved in
          and anialated the city even further.  On May 2, 1945, the
           Soviets triumphed over the U.S. and British
          and Berlin fell to Soviet forces.  However,
          since the Soviets did not win the war, at the Yalta
          Conference held on February of the same year, the Allied
          leaders confirmed that Berlin would be occupied by the
          Soviet Union, Great Britain, and the U.S.  The Allied
          powers, consisting of Great Britain, the U.S., and France
          would occupy the western part of the city.  The Soviets, the
          eastern part.<P>
               Over time, hostility between the two sides
          hardened the division.  In June 1948, the Soviet Union cut
          off all land communications between the western sectors of
          Berlin and West Germany.  This blockade lasted until 1949.
          During that time, supplies were brought to Western Berlin by
          U.S. and British cargo planes (The Berlin Airlift).  The
          same year, the U.S., British, and French sectors joined
          together to form West Berlin.  East Berlin became known as
          the Soviet Sector.<P>
               Soon, many East Berlin inhabitants began to flee to
          West Berlin to escape communist rule.  An attempt to stop
          the departure of proffesionals, intellectuals, and skilled
          workers to the West encouraged the constructuion of the
          Berlin Wall.  This massive electrified barricade was first
          erected on August 12-13, 1961.  It  stood 10 feet tall, 75
          miles long around the city of West Berlin, and was topped
           with massive amounts of barbed wire.<P>
